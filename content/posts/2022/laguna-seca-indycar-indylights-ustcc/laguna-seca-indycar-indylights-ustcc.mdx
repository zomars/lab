Let me start with a confession - I don't follow Indycar closely and this race happened a
while back.
I do remember that it was a very hot day, and next time around I will bring an umbrella to
protect myself from the lovely Californian sun.
Also, I was there on Saturday only.

## United States Touring Car Qualifying and Race 1

USTCC has four classes defined by the power-to-weight ratio: Sportsman, Touring, Super Touring
and GT.
All these classes race together - slower packs trailing faster ones at the start.

To me this is the most relatable series of all - cars look familiar and there was some
close racing within classes.
It was fun to watch GT and ST overtaking slower cars in the turn two - either by getting ahead
of them before the braking zone or over-braking them into the turn.

The red NSX looks sooo good! Definitely the eye candy of the event.

Also, check out the [MFG Motorsport car](https://www.mfgmotorsports.com/garage)
combining elements of IndyCar, Silver Crown (ovals warrior) and dirt car wings.
Not sure what it is called, may be the _Road Course Sprint Car_?

Even though overtakes were plentiful, most classes had a car (or two) leading the whole race:
- GT: Kip Olson in [Driving Ambition](https://www.instagram.com/driving_ambition_motorsports) Acura NSX
- ST: Viktor Czapla in
  [Cool Boxx](https://www.instagram.com/_coolboxx_)/[034Motorosport](https://www.instagram.com/034motorsport/) Audi R8
- SP: Matt Million in [Palomar Racing](https://www.instagram.com/palomar_racing) E36 BMW M3
- TC: not sure if he led all the time, but [Gary Trudeau](https://www.instagram.com/gary.trudeau/) in
  [Red Panther Motorsport](https://www.instagram.com/redpanthermotorsport/) Hyundai Genesis came first

## Spec Racer Ford Qualifying and Race

[Caleb Shrader](https://www.instagram.com/caleb_shrader_racing/) in
[Flat Out Racing](https://www.instagram.com/flatoutracingltd/) car #99 comfortably led the
race with Federico Mosconi coming close second in #00 car.

It appeared as if #00 had an issue with brake bias throughout the race - rear brakes were
locking wheels in turn 2 every other lap.

## IndyLights Qualifying and Race 1

[Sting Ray Bob](https://www.instagram.com/stingrayrobb/) took the pole position and
comfortably led Saturday race.
[Christian Rasmussen](https://www.instagram.com/christian_rasmussen_/) came second with
[Hunter McElrea](https://www.instagram.com/huntermcelrea/) third.

## IndyCar Qualifying

IndyCar has an interesting qualification format: two initial rounds with half of the grid each,
another round were top 6 from both rounds compete (12 in total), and the final one -
between the top six drivers.

Top three qualifiers were [Alexander Rossi](https://www.instagram.com/alexanderrossi/),
[Romain Grosjean](https://www.instagram.com/grosjeanromain/)
(didn't [crash the pace car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sl91aOlhAo) this time around) and
[Will Power](https://www.instagram.com/12willpower/) who later proceeded to win the
2022 Championship (but not the race) on Sunday.

_That's all for today - see you guys and, hopefully, girls on the track!_

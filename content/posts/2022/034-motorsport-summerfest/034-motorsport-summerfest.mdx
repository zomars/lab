_034Motorsport_ is a California based car tuning company founded in 2005.
Today they offer a variety of software and hardware products for Audi, VW and BMW vehicles.
Most are designed and oftentimes manufactured in-house.

_SummerFest_ is the annual get-together event for
_[034Motorsport](https://www.034motorsport.com)_
fans and customers and is held next to their shop in Fremont California.
This was my first _SummerFest_ and first car event of 2022 season.

034 service zone with four car posts was open to everybody and had their development
and tastefully-tuned employee's cars on display.
You could inspect car specs and torture 034 representatives to death with
technical questions. I certainly did my part!
They were offering 10% discount for orders made on the spot and were taking job applications.

Every few hours there was a facility tours where you walked through the storage racks,
dyno stand, some development offices and could get a taste of their day-to-day life
and nature of the business.

They talked a little about cracking different car manufactures ECUs and what
it takes to design, test and develop a hardware product before it hits the market.

Their founder and current CEO, [Javad Shadzi](https://www.instagram.com/javadshadzi/),
was standing in front of the grill for three or four hours to feed everyone with
delicious tri-tip sandwiches and chicken thighs.
Meat was very good indeed, and I have to admit that I stayed in that line more than once.

And then there was a parking lot full of (mostly) german cars and their passionate owners.
Some of those participated in the judged concourse, but I didn't stay long enough to know
who the winners were.
Spec lists were thoroughly impressive though and that's when I decided _against_ carbon
fiber fenders on my MK6 GTI.

For me this was a great season kick off, and I do recommend everyone interested in car
parts engineering and european cars to experience it.

Oh, and did I mention that it is free to attend? Cheers!

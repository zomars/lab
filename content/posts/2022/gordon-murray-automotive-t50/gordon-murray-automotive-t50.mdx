Right after the Monterey Car Week Gordon Murray stopped at Canepa HQ with a gray GMA T33 and
light-blue GMA T50.
I haven't been to Canepa before, and having Gordon there was just too good of a coincidence
to be missed.

After roaming around the [show room and museum floors](/posts/2022/canepa-open-house)
we were let into the workshop area with these two supercars and... the Maestro himself.

<Note>
  [Gordon Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Murray)
  designed quite a few very successful F1 cars for Brabham and McLaren F1 teams.

  While at McLaren also designed his first road legal super car -
  [McLaren F1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_F1).
</Note>

T50 and T33 conceived by his very own _Gordon Murray Design_ company continue
where McLaren F1 left off over than two decades ago.

GMA T33 was present as well but is not featured here.
Firstly - because it didn't look nearly as good as T50, and, secondly - it
was much harder to take picture of without getting too many folks into the frame.
Also grey doesn't really stand the competiton against that sky-blue.

Honestly I didn't know much about GMA cars before seeing them in flash and felt
way too dumb to ask Gordon anything, even though he was very approachable and didn't
get upset with people asking random question.
I've got my signed poster though!

Afterwards I did find out that the engine is a naturally aspirated 4.0L V12
revving up to 12100 rpm.
Car features a 6-speed manual gearbox and weights under a ton.
_Few exclamation marks here!_

  Review approaches to clearing (invalidating) GitHub actions cache by updating key and
  restore-keys in an easy and predictable fashion (with env variables).
summary: >-
  Cache invalidation is one of the most complex computer science tasks.
  Especially so for GitHub action workflows since there is no embedded mechanism to
  clean or invalidate present caches.
  However, what we can do is to update cache keys with a dedicated environment variable
  of the workflow or repository secret.
---

The need to invalidate existent GitHub action caches can raise at any time but
is especially useful when working on various build optimizations and tuning
GitHub actions workflow itself.

Since there is no _native_ way to do so we have to rely on updating
[cache](https://github.com/actions/cache#readme) `key` **and** `restore-keys` fields.
Fortunately, when defining keys we can use expressions referencing environment variables or
even GitHub action secrets.

Then by updating corresponding variables (with workflow file update or through GitHub UI) we
in fact will invalidate all caches referring those variables.
Now, all subsequent workflow runs will create new caches with updated cache key values.

<Note>

  **Pro tip:** Set
  [`ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging)
  flag on when working on GitHub action workflows.
  It makes debugging quite a bit easier.

</Note>

### Workflow Environment Variable
With this approach we are defining the workflow level environment variable `cache_version`
which can be changed anytime later by updating the workflow file.

Once its value changes, all cache keys are updated and cache generation starts from scratch.

Old caches remain in the GH cloud storage and will be automatically removed by github based on
their [eviction policy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#usage-limits-and-eviction-policy).

<Note>

Technically, once the eviction happened you could revert the `cache_version` value back to its
original value but in practice this is not used. There is simply no need - we can keep incrementing
the value when needed.

</Note>

```yaml
name: PR Update

on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  cache_version: 1.1

jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: node_modules cache
        id: node-modules-cache
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        env:
          cache_name: node-modules-${{ env.cache_version }}
          hash: ${{ hashFiles('package.lock') }}
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ env.cache_name }}-${{ env.hash }}
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ env.cache_name }}-
```

We could also piggyback on an existent env variable such as `node_version` and add (or change)
its minor version in order to invalidate the cache.

This is not the recommended approach however, because behavior of nodeJs might change even
with a minor version update.
You might also end up locking in a particular minor nodeJs version instead of using the
latest minor for the defined major i.e. `node_version: 16.13` instead of `node_version: 16`.

On the flip side you will invalidate all the cache automatically whenever a major node
version change occurs.

Now lets combine the best of both worlds:

```yaml
name: PR Update

on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  cache_version: 1.1
  node_version: 16

jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: node_modules cache
        id: node-modules-cache
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        env:
          prefix: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ env.node_version }}
          cache_name: node-modules-${{ env.cache_version }}
          hash: ${{ hashFiles('package.lock') }}
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: ${{ env.prefix }}-${{ env.cache_name }}-${{ env.hash }}
          restore-keys: ${{ env.prefix }}-${{ env.cache_name }}-
```

Now we can invalidate cache by updating `cache_version` variable whenever we need to do so.
At the same time our cache gets invalidated automatically every time we bump nodeJs version.

### Repository Secret
If you prefer to invalidate GitHub action caches from the GitHub UI you can refer repository
secrets in your cache key expressions.

Please note however that these secrets might **not** be immediately available for
[dependabot PRs](http://localhost:8000/posts/2021/dependabot-pull-request-github-actions/)
or PRs coming from forks of your repository.

```yaml
name: PR Update

on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  node_version: 16

jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: node_modules cache
        id: node-modules-cache
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        env:
          prefix: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ env.node_version }}
          cache_name: node-modules-${{ secrets.CACHE_VERSION }}
          hash: ${{ hashFiles('package.lock') }}
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: ${{ env.prefix }}-${{ env.cache_name }}-${{ env.hash }}
          restore-keys: ${{ env.prefix }}-${{ env.cache_name }}-
```

Once this approach is implemented you can go to the repository settings UI and
[update](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
`CACHE_VERSION` secret value.
All subsequent workflow runs will be creating relevant caches from scratch.

### Conclusion
Even though there is no embedded mechanism to clear the GitHub actions cache we can achieve
that fairly easily with environment variables and updated workflow file.

Which in a way tells us that GitHub actions team came up with a succinct yet sufficient `cache`
action API.
They avoided adding specialized functionality when in fact workflow syntax already provides
us with generic (and likely familiar) means to achieve our goal.

_Convenient? No! Efficient and reliable? Yes!_

Few car pics from Carmel-By-The-Sea downtown on Thursday afternoon during the 2022
Monterey Car Week.

I couldn't think of a better place to park when headed to the Pebble Beach event.
It worked out alright, but street parking is very limited and adjacent streets
have road signs _prohibiting_ non-residential parking.

<Note>
  Pebble Beach Golf Links course is a ten-minutes uphill bike ride from Carmel.
  But having bike at Pebble proved handy due to the scale of the event area
  and ability to skip traffic in heavily congested streets around the golf course.
  I'll share my Pebble Beach experiences in a separate post.

Once parked and negotiated with a friendly local resident my _unconstitutional_
right for negligence, I hesitated and, instead of assembling my bike, followed the music.

Which inevitably lead me to a few downtown blocks closed off to traffic and
densely packed with beautiful cars.
Cars of various brands and age - from american cars of 40-th to modern Ferrari, Maserati
and Lamborghini cabriolets.

Apparently, this was the
[Prancing Ponies](https://prancingponies.org/)
event where ladies presented their favorite (and still mostly combustion-driven) ponies to
everyone's enjoyment.
All proceeds from the event go to the 501(c)3 _Prancing Ponies Foundation_ supporting
underrepresented and low-income woman.

Quite a few classic cars featured on this page were presented by the
[Monterey Touring Vehicles](https://www.montereytouringvehicles.com/) company.
Their cars were in an immaculate shape and are available for rent in the area.
_Hey, if folks from MTV are reading this, please sponsor my stay for the next year event!_

Ocean Avenue, being a street of historic and authentic buildings, certainly
provided a unique and somewhat magical stage for the event.
Most guests looked the part - well-dressed, interested and vibrant.
Generally visitors come to Carmel for the stroll down the picturesque Ocean Avenue
and to have lunch in one of the many fancy restaurants.
And for them this display of cars was a lovely bonus.

<Note>

  Carmel downtown usually hosts the
  [_Carmel-by-the-Sea Concourse on the Avenue_](https://carmelconcours.com/home.html)
  event but it
  [got cancelled](https://www.montereyherald.com/2022/05/26/carmel-will-not-host-concours-on-the-avenue-this-year/)
  for the 2022.

Next year I plan to stop by for the
[_Carmel-by-the-Sea Concourse on the Avenue_](https://carmelconcours.com/home.html).
Might as well get a cup of so-so coffee and a decent pastry.

_See you there!_

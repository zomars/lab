## History Bit

[Canepa](https://canepa.com) (also known as _Canepa Design_ and _Canepa Motorsport_)
is the well-known restoration, tuning and service facility specializing in exotic, classic and
sports cars.
Historically their name is strongly connected with
[Porsche 959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_959)
&mdash; they service, restore, tune and make 959s legal to drive in US since 1988.

To this day they have restored almost forty 959s out of approximately 350 ever produced.
They were involved in passing the [show-n-display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_or_Display)
law in US, which introduced the way to import and register previously non-eligible (not certified)
but historically significant cars.

Canepa has grown a lot since 1985 and extended their expertise in
various European brands &mdash; Ferrari, Porsche, BMW, Mercedes and Bugatti to name a few.

Company's office and shop (block of office buildings which were occupied by Seagate)
is located in Scotts Valley - small town on the way from San Francisco South bay to Santa Cruz
on the Pacific Coast.
It is somewhat remote and absolutely beautiful location in Santa Cruz mountains &mdash;
far enough from silicon valley buzz, but close enough for the local tow truck hitch-ride.

Spirited drive from Canepa to the nearest ocean beach will take just about twenty minutes.
Then you can take Pacific Coast Highway up North &mdash; towards Half Moon Bay and San Francisco
(more traffic) or down South &mdash; to Monterey, Big Sur and San Luis Obispo.
Proper routes for testing suspension setup and engine tuning.

I've been planning to visit them for a while and, once an Open House with Gordon Murray,
visiting on a Monday after the Monterey Car Week was announced, I immediately knew &mdash;
the time has come!

## Canepa Show Room

The show room on the first floor is a spacious, if a bit dark,
area, hosting the rotating exhibit of remarkable cars available for purchase.
Every car has a _recommendation letter_ &mdash; spec sheet extended with car's
(and, sometimes, its owner) biography details.
You can also find them online - on [Canepa's Inventory](https://canepa.com/inventory/)
website page.

## Canepa Motorsports Museum

After absorbing more recent examples of technological miracles, timeless design
and engineering beauty, it's time to head upstairs for the refreshing sight of
various motorsport equipment.

Cars and motorcycles from different eras, competition classes and driven
by various drivers &mdash; all handpicked by [Bruce Canepa](https://canepa.com/bruce_canepa/)
&mdash; founder of the company.
In some of these cars he had competed himself &mdash; like this
[1980 Pike's Peak Special](https://canepa.com/museum/1980-canepa-pikes-peak-special/) which
got him the second place overall in 1981.

You can explore the museum collection [online](https://canepa.com/canepa-difference/canepa-museum/).

## Canepa Shop Floor

Once you are done with the sports cars and bike, go around the staircase
and through unremarkable door leading to the cat-walk observing the service bay.

It's a lovely sight &mdash; bright, spacious, clean, well organized and full of exotic cars
of a different age. Show-case of a garage which came straight from heaven.

From there you can spot a few service bays surrounded with storage shelves used for
parts taken off cars during extensive restorations and repairs.
Upholstery area, engine machine shop and paint bays can be seen on the edge of the service zone.

All of the above can be explored at any time during regular working hours and
won't require an invitation or ticket for any particular event.

However, since I was there during the "official" Open House day, I got a chance
to wander around the shop floor by myself and take as many pictures as I wanted.

You can't see it from the observation deck, but further into the shop there is a car storage
area with the signature 4-level car parking rack.

## Wrapping Up

Hope you enjoyed these pictures and I can't recommend the place enough.
For one, I will be back to check on new show room arrivals and walk around the shop once again.
There are so many interesting details there! I certainly got overwhelmed on my first visit.

**Thanks, Canepa, for such an outstanding, accessible and accommodating operation!**

Folks working there are living a dream!

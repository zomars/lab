summary: >-
  Annual gathering of Porsche owners during 2022 Monterey Car Week.
  Ever modern and fashionable Porsche cars from 50s to our days.
  Mostly original and in "better than new" condition.
  Every generation of every model!
  Rainbow of colors, especially on models from 70-th but new 20-th are trying to get back
  into the color game.
  My favourite 911 body of this year is 912.

Porsche Werks Reunion is back at Monterey golf course grounds.
It's an annual single day car show with top-tier _Judged Field_ of some 165(!) cars
and sparkling _corrals_ - glorified parking lots organized by car model and generation.

Porsche cars only - every model from 356 to Taycan (sorry, not featured today).

## 356

## 911/912

[Porsche Classic Restoration Challenge](https://www.porsche.com/usa/accessoriesandservices/classic/classic-world-events/classic-restoration-challenge)
presented a field of West Region contestants.
This was a competition between US Porsche dealerships organized by PCNA.
Cars were bought locally in various states of despair and got restored by
dealers in about 8 month time in-house by their own stuff.

Plenty of special editions (which I know very little about, sorry) with a sprinkle
of race-cars with competition history.
Contrary to Monterey Reunion at Laguna Seca, this is more of _lifelong love for Porsche_
event with perks like wine, live music and _right-out-of-the-oven_ pizza.
Food options were plenty with prices matching the significance of the occasion.

## 944 Turbo

Monterey Pines Golf Course has a lovely park-like atmosphere with planes flying
just over your head right before landing at the nearby Monterey Airport.
August mornings here are foggy, and planes coming out of haze moments before
hitting the runaway is truly unique and delightful sight.
This free admission event is well worth of your visit because of the site and
atmosphere itself!

## 930, 964 & 993

Possibly because of that, and, of course, rows of beautiful Porsche cars,
event was packed with spectators.
I came as early as was allowed for general public, but that didn't help much.
Some of these photos took patience and determination.
On a other hand I had a few enlightening conversations with Porsche owners -
very devoted, passionate and knowledgeable bunch!

## 996 & 992

Another problem with arriving early is the weather.
I've spent there a better part of the day, and in the afternoon was awarded with the sun
coming through the fog.
It brought even more colors to already beautiful scenery - hope you can spot the difference in
photos.

General parking was $40 cash, but you could treat yourself with an additional 20 minutes
walk from the closest (and ample) street parking along the Garden Road.

### See You There in 2023!
They were gone at the end of the day
_(in fact, the very next day [2022 Concorso Italiano](https://sportscardigest.com/2022-concorso-italiano/)
took place on same grounds)_ but I'm certain they will be back next year.
See you then!

Also, *huge thanks to all volunteers who helped to make it happen!*

Everyone knows _AngularJs_ (version 1.x) is
[done and dusted](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=angularjs)!
Why write anything about it today, in 2021?

Well, the reason is pretty simple - history moves in spirals, and things we've
learned yesterday shape today and tomorrow.

Knowledge of prior frameworks and related tooling comes "for free" if you had been in the
industry long enough and used them on a daily basis.
However, if you are a newcomer - almost certainly you won't have that _historical_ perspective.
Usually, when starting our development careers, we work with popular tools of today.
Unless, of course, you are unlucky enough to join the team supporting huge legacy codebase.

Absence of historical knowledge, generally speaking, won't hurt in the short run,
but does impede your growth over the course of your professional career.

_Any framework as in itself can be seen as a coding pattern. Or, usually, quite a few of those._

Let's not forget that _AngularJs_ was the default framework of choice for
single-page applications for a few years:
[from 2014 to 2018](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=angularjs,react).
Such applications (especially in the enterprise world) tend to hang around for a while after
they had been written and released. I believe even today **thousands** of UI engineers across
the world maintain and develop AngularJs apps. In fact, some of them could be working on
migrating those apps to newer frameworks right now - lets pause here for a second and wish
them luck!

[LTS support](/posts/2021/angularjs-good-parts/unglamorous-end) for _AngularJs_
was extended till the end of 2021 due to the Covid, and even after that no one would
stop you from forking the repo and applying bug-fixes your team deems necessary.

In this post I want to list concepts/approaches which are used in _AngularJs_ and worked
really well for the huge and fairly well designed enterprise UI app over the span
of seven years.
To me that sounds like a seal of approval - for the framework itself.

### Good parts of AngularJs framework
1. dependency injection
   - very basic but still modules (`.config` and `.run` phases), instantiation of factories
     and services
   - unit tests mocking mechanism
   - built-in dependency mocks
2. components (directives) approach
   - bindings (props) including callbacks
   - lifecycle hooks
   - transclusion (projection/`props.children`)
   - `require` for "protected" communication between components
   - separation of component logic from the template (with template live-loading support)
   - event bus
3. built-in forms library
   - two-way bindings
   - parsers, formatters, validators
   - getters and setters for `ng-model` values
   - creating objects on the fly when `a.b.c` is being passed as `ng-model` attribute value
4. `http` service introducing a dedicated layer responsible for all API calls
   - comes with great API to intercept and modify/supplement API requests and responses
5. digest loop (change detection) which in 95% of cases doesn't require developer to use any
   special syntax, particular data management approach or to rely on lifecycle hooks.
   - various tools to hook up to it when required (i.e. from other libraries, such as D3)
6. being an OOP oriented framework. I believe OOP concepts are more complex and, I dare to say,
   versatile in comparison to Functional programming concepts.
7. decent development documentation. Not ideal but good enough.
8. Large user community leading to a wide choice of third-party libraries as
   well as decent (especially in its early years) development pace by core team at Google.
9. High debug-ability in DevTools Console (no plugins necessary).
   Any service could be injected by its name in runtime.

We shouldn't forget that definition of technological *good* was quite different in 2014
(and _AngularJS_ itself was designed much earlier than that).
I.e. module system of _AngularJs_ is definitely inferior to the one used today in Angular.
And as far as I'm concerned, that's totally fine, because lessons learned from that version of
DI are still very valuable and, for the most part, do apply to the future generations of UI
applications and frameworks.

_Thanks for everything and Rest in Peace, AngularJs_!
